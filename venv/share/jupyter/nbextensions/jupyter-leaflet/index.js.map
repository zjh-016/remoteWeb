events to drop targets:\n *\n * - `'lm-dragenter'` - Dispatched when the mouse enters the target\n *   element. This event must be canceled in order to receive any\n *   of the other events.\n *\n * - `'lm-dragover'` - Dispatched when the mouse moves over the drop\n *   target. It must cancel the event and set the `dropAction` to one\n *   of the supported actions in order to receive drop events.\n *\n * - `'lm-dragleave'` - Dispatched when the mouse leaves the target\n *   element. This includes moving the mouse into child elements.\n *\n * - `'lm-drop'`- Dispatched when the mouse is released over the target\n *   element when the target indicates an appropriate drop action. If\n *   the event is canceled, the indicated drop action is returned to\n *   the initiator through the resolved promise.\n *\n * A drag operation can be terminated at any time by pressing `Escape`\n * or by disposing the drag object.\n *\n * A drag object has the ability to automatically scroll a scrollable\n * element when the mouse is hovered near one of its edges. To enable\n * this, add the `data-lm-dragscroll` attribute to any element which\n * the drag object should consider for scrolling.\n *\n * #### Notes\n * This class is designed to be used when dragging and dropping custom\n * data *within* a single application. It is *not* a replacement for\n * the native drag-drop API. Instead, it provides an API which allows\n * drag operations to be initiated programmatically and enables the\n * transfer of arbitrary non-string objects; features which are not\n * possible with the native drag-drop API.\n */\nvar Drag = /** @class */ (function () {\n    /**\n     * Construct a new drag object.\n     *\n     * @param options - The options for initializing the drag.\n     */\n    function Drag(options) {\n        var _this = this;\n        /**\n         * The scroll loop handler function.\n         */\n        this._onScrollFrame = function () {\n            // Bail early if there is no scroll target.\n            if (!_this._scrollTarget) {\n                return;\n            }\n            // Unpack the scroll target.\n            var _a = _this._scrollTarget, element = _a.element, edge = _a.edge, distance = _a.distance;\n            // Calculate the scroll delta using nonlinear acceleration.\n            var d = Private.SCROLL_EDGE_SIZE - distance;\n            var f = Math.pow(d / Private.SCROLL_EDGE_SIZE, 2);\n            var s = Math.max(1, Math.round(f * Private.SCROLL_EDGE_SIZE));\n            // Scroll the element in the specified direction.\n            switch (edge) {\n                case 'top':\n                    element.scrollTop -= s;\n                    break;\n                case 'left':\n                    element.scrollLeft -= s;\n                    break;\n                case 'right':\n                    element.scrollLeft += s;\n                    break;\n                case 'bottom':\n                    element.scrollTop += s;\n                    break;\n            }\n            // Request the next cycle of the scroll loop.\n            requestAnimationFrame(_this._onScrollFrame);\n        };\n        this._disposed = false;\n        this._dropAction = 'none';\n        this._override = null;\n        this._currentTarget = null;\n        this._currentElement = null;\n        this._promise = null;\n        this._scrollTarget = null;\n        this._resolve = null;\n        this.mimeData = options.mimeData;\n        this.dragImage = options.dragImage || null;\n        this.proposedAction = options.proposedAction || 'copy';\n        this.supportedActions = options.supportedActions || 'all';\n        this.source = options.source || null;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Dispose of the resources held by the drag object.\n     *\n     * #### Notes\n     * This will cancel the drag operation if it is active.\n     */\n    Drag.prototype.dispose = function () {\n        // Do nothing if the drag object is already disposed.\n        if (this._disposed) {\n            return;\n        }\n        this._disposed = true;\n        // If there is a current target, dispatch a drag leave event.\n        if (this._currentTarget) {\n            var event_1 = Private.createMouseEvent('mouseup', -1, -1);\n            Private.dispatchDragLeave(this, this._currentTarget, null, event_1);\n        }\n        // Finalize the drag object with `'none'`.\n        this._finalize('none');\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(Drag.prototype, \"isDisposed\", {\n        /**\n         * Test whether the drag object is disposed.\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._disposed;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * Start the drag operation at the specified client position.\n     *\n     * @param clientX - The client X position for the drag start.\n     *\n     * @param clientY - The client Y position for the drag start.\n     *\n     * @returns A promise which resolves to the result of the drag.\n     *\n     * #### Notes\n     * If the drag has already been started, the promise created by the\n     * first call to `start` is returned.\n     *\n     * If the drag operation has ended, or if the drag object has been\n     * disposed, the returned promise will resolve to `'none'`.\n     *\n     * The drag object will be automatically disposed when drag operation\n     * completes.
